                            A hundred days have made me older
                            Since the last <br>time that I saw your pretty face
                            A thousand lies <br>have made me colder
                            And I don't think I can look at this the same
                            <br>
                            But all the miles that separate<br>
                            Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still on my lonely mind<br>
                            I think about you, baby
                            And I dream about you all the time<br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still with me in my dreams<br>
                            And tonight it's only you and me, yeah
                            <br>
                            The miles just keep rollin'<br>
                            As the people leave their way to say "Hello"<br>
                            <br>
                            I've heard this life is overrated
                            But I hope that it gets better as we go<br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still on my lonely mind<br>
                            I think about you, baby
                            And I dream about you all the time<br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still with me in my dreams<br>
                            And tonight, girl, it's only you and me<br>
                            <br>
                            Everything I know
                            And anywhere I go
                            It gets hard<br>
                            But it won't take away my love
                            And when the last one falls
                            When it's all <br>said and done
                            It gets hard
                            But it won't take away my love
                            <br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still on my lonely mind<br>
                            I think about you, baby
                            And I dream about you all the time<br>
                            I'm here without you, baby
                            But you're still with me in my dreams
                            And tonight, girl, <br>it's only you and me.</p>
